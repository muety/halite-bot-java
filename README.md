This is my rule-based solution for the [Halite](https://halite.io) AI competition. My bot is playing as [n1try](https://halite.io/user/?user_id=7481) and its best rank in the leaderboard was __250__. I also wrote a [blog post](https://ferdinand-muetsch.de/halite-a-rule-based-ai-bot.html) about this.

Based on the [Java starter kit](https://halite.io/learn-programming-challenge/downloads-and-starter-kits/). Unix binaries (instead of `halite.exe`) can be found there to. 

__If you're using my code to compete in the challenge, please give me a star ðŸ˜‡.__

## Usage
* `run_game.bat` to compile the code and locally run the bot against three clones of itself
* `run_clean.bat` to clear all `.class` files as well as logs, replays and ZIP archives from the root directory

Shell scripts for Unix are not included but it should be trivial to derive them from the above Batch scripts.
